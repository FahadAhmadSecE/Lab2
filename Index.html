<h3>Bungie </h3>
<p> Bungie is one of the biggest downfalls of recent. Ruining their game with worse and worse paid DLC's and laying off important parts of their team.<br>  Their downfall began when they bought themselves out from treyarch, allowing them to take over completely and fill their best franchise Destiny with the most outrageous microtransactions</p>

<h3> Overwatch/Blizzard </h3>
<p> Blizzard failed overwatch, overpromising for years. They released overwatch 2 which was an overall fail. <br> Overwatch 2 had been in the works for 4 years or so, and yet on release it included</p>
<ul>
    <li> 1 new character </li>
    <li> few new maps</li>
    <li> BATTLEPASS </li>
    <li> Increase in all prices and removal of free grind for cosmetic</li>
</ul>

<h3> Concord </h3>
<p> Concord is a failure that was never up. This game was in the works for 8 years, over 250 million in budget <br> It tried entering an over-saturated genre, and came in with complete gargabe <br> The character design was terrible, gameplay is nothing new <br> The only good thing that came about this game, is the fact that some of the developers are quitting the industry</p>
